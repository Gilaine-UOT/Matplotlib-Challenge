# Matplotlib-Challenge
A study to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

## Three observations from the Data Analysis

* 1) Capomulin and Ramicane

Capomulin and Ramicane showed a similar result in terms of effectiveness, reducing the size of the tumor in cubic millimeters, which had the best result, compared to the others drugs regimen.

 * 2) Ketapril and Naftisol 

Ketapril and Naftisol when analysing the tumor volume variance had increased more than with placebo.  

* 3) Capomulin and Ramicane were the highest results in Timepoints tested per drug regimen 

## Summary Statistics
Included in this table are the mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume for each drug regimen.
